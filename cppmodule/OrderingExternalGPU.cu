//! Kernel for calculating external forces
/*! This kernel is called to calculate the external forces on all N particles. Actual evaluation of the potentials and
    forces for each particle is handled via the template class \a evaluator.

    \param d_force Device memory to write computed forces
    \param d_virial Device memory to write computed virials
    \param virial_pitch pitch of 2D virial array
    \param N number of particles
    \param d_pos device array of particle positions
    \param box Box dimensions used to implement periodic boundary conditions
    \param params per-type array of parameters for the potential
